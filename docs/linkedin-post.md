# LinkedIn Post: Spec-Driven Data Pipelines

## Main Post

**What if LLMs could generate your data pipelines in seconds—but you still need to be a better engineer?**

I've been experimenting with a spec-driven approach to data pipeline development that's changing how I think about the role of data engineers in the age of AI.

**Here's the controversial take:** LLMs don't make engineering easier. They make it **harder** and **more valuable**.

### The Core Idea

Instead of manually translating business requirements into code, we create a structured JSON specification that serves as the single source of truth. From there:

✅ LLMs generate platform-specific code (DBT, Dataform, PySpark, etc.)
✅ Tests are auto-generated alongside code
✅ Visual diagrams created deterministically (no hallucination risk)
✅ Human review validates everything before production

### Why This Matters

**The shift isn't about writing less code. It's about elevating engineering focus:**

❌ **Before:** Writing SQL syntax, debugging syntax errors
✅ **Now:** Reviewing generated code, designing test strategies, ensuring quality

**The critical bottleneck?** Testing and validation.

When code can be regenerated in 30 seconds, can you validate it's correct in 30 seconds? If not, you have a problem.

This requires engineers with **higher-level skills:**
- Specification design
- Comprehensive test strategy
- Code review at scale
- Performance optimization
- Security validation

### The Reality Check

JSON specs are machine-readable but human-unfriendly. So we generate Mermaid diagrams and tables **deterministically** (using Python, not LLMs) to help humans review quickly while maintaining perfect consistency.

The JSON is the source of truth. Everything else is derived from it.

### What I'm Still Figuring Out

- How to design test frameworks that keep pace with rapid code generation
- Best practices for reviewing LLM-generated SQL at scale
- Balancing speed with quality in this new workflow
- Training teams to shift from code writers to code reviewers

**The key insight:** Engineers don't become less important. They become **more crucial**—focusing on judgment, architecture, and quality instead of syntax.

## Alternative Shorter Version (Character-Limited Version)

**LLMs can generate my data pipelines in 30 seconds. Validating they're correct? That's the hard part.**

I've been experimenting with spec-driven data pipelines where:
- Business requirements → Structured JSON spec → LLM-generated code + tests
- Visual diagrams generated deterministically (no hallucination risk)
- Human review remains critical

**The controversial insight:** This doesn't make engineering easier. It makes it **more challenging and valuable**.

Engineers shift from:
❌ Writing SQL syntax
✅ Designing specs, test strategies, and ensuring quality

When code regenerates in seconds, your bottleneck becomes validation and review—skills that require deeper expertise than syntax.

The JSON spec is the source of truth. Everything else is derived from it.

## Engagement Prompts (Pick One to Add)

**Option 1 (Question-focused):**
> Question for the community: How are you handling testing and validation in your LLM-assisted development workflows?

**Option 2 (Experience-sharing):**
> I'd love to hear from others building with LLMs—are you seeing similar challenges around testing and code review? What's working for you?

**Option 3 (Debate-starter):**
> Hot take: The real value of senior engineers will be in validating AI-generated code, not writing it. Agree or disagree?

**Option 4 (Problem-focused):**
> The biggest unsolved problem I'm facing: How do you build test frameworks that keep pace with code that regenerates every 30 seconds?

## Tips for Posting

1. **Best time to post:** Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10 AM or 12-1 PM (your local time)

2. **Pin a comment** with additional context:
   > "This approach came from struggling with ambiguous requirements and constantly changing platforms. The JSON spec becomes a contract between business and engineering—no more 'I thought you meant...' conversations."

3. **Engage with comments** by:
   - Asking clarifying questions
   - Sharing specific examples from your experience
   - Acknowledging different perspectives
   - Inviting people to share their approaches

4. **Follow-up posts** (if this gets traction):
   - Deep dive into test strategy design
   - How to review LLM-generated SQL
   - Real example of spec → code → tests workflow
   - Lessons learned from production deployment

5. **Tag relevant people** (if appropriate):
   - Colleagues who worked on this
   - Thought leaders in data engineering
   - People who've shared similar ideas
